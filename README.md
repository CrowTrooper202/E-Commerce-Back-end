# E-Commerce-Back-end

## Description

- As an employ to a small start up company, the manager approached me to develop an electronic commerce tracker for our retail products.
- after being provided with the starter code i then started filling in the necessary code. first stating with the information needed in the models, moving on to the relationships between them, and finally building the necessary routes to create, read, update, delete, and update as needed.
- Some key take away lessons was the the importance of syntax in the models as a single small error resulted in the entire server failing. another key take away the the importance of server setup, as having the sequelize sync at the wrong value will result on empty arrays.
